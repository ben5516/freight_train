# FreightTrain To-Do

### Refactor to be Prototype-independent

  - Create an adapter that relies on jQuery; test w/o Prototype

### Other

  - FT new rows don't get hover effect
  - FT needs to scope events e.g. FT.Tag.after_init rather than InlineEditor.after_init
  - FT could use custom DOM events rather than its observer?
  - FT should use event delegation
